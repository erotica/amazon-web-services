          if you want to use a non-default CMK; if this parameter is not specified,
          the      default CMK for EBS is used. The ARN contains the arn:aws:kms namespace,

          the key namespace, and then the CMK ID. For example, arn:aws:kms:us-east-1:012345678910:key/abcd1234-a123-456a-a12b-a123b4cd56ef.

          with the Amazon EC2 Query API; it is available as an      optional parameter
          in all other cases. The PresignedUrl should use the snapshot      source
          endpoint, the CopySnapshot action, and include the        SourceRegion,
          SourceSnapshotId, and DestinationRegion      parameters. The PresignedUrl
          must be signed using AWS Signature Version 4.      Because EBS snapshots
          are stored in Amazon S3, the signing algorithm for this parameter uses the      same

          (AWS Signature Version 4) in the        Amazon Simple Storage Service API
          Reference. An invalid or improperly signed PresignedUrl will cause      the
