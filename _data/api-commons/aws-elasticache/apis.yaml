description: Amazon ElastiCache is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate,
  and scale an in-memory data store or cache inu0026nbsp;the cloud. The service improves
  the performance of web applications by allowing you to retrieve information from
  fast, managed, in-memory data stores, instead of relying entirely on slower disk-based
  databases. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory engines:nnRedisu0026nbsp;-
  a fast, open source, in-memory data store and cache.u0026nbsp;Amazon ElastiCache
  for Redisu0026nbsp;is a Redis-compatible in-memory service that delivers the ease-of-use
  and power of Redis along with the availability, reliability and performance suitable
  for the most demanding applications. Both single-node and up to 15-shard clusters
  are available, enabling scalability to up to 3.55 TiB of in-memory data. ElastiCache
  for Redis is fully managed, scalable, and secure - making it an ideal candidate
  to power high-performance use cases such as Web, Mobile Apps, Gaming, Ad-Tech, and
  IoT.nnnMemcached - a widely adopted memory object caching system. ElastiCache is
  protocol compliant with Memcached, so popular tools that you use today with existing
  Memcached environments will work seamlessly with the service.nnAmazon ElastiCache
  automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing the overhead associated
  with self-managed infrastructures and provides a resilient system that mitigates
  the risk of overloaded databases, which slow website and application load times.
  Through integration withu0026nbsp;Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides
  enhanced visibility into key performance metrics associated with your Redis or Memcached
  nodes.nUsing Amazon ElastiCache, you can add an in-memory layer to your infrastructure
  in a matter of minutes by using theu0026nbsp;AWS Management Console.
