This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want tttAmazon Route 53 to perform health checks.When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:If you specify a value of 80 for Port andttttttHTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes thetttttvalue of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Hosttttttheader.If you specify a value of 443 for Port andttttttHTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passestttttthe value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Hosttttttheader.If you specify another value for Port and any value exceptttttttTCP for Type, Amazon Route 53 passesttttttt                           FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port                         to thetttttendpoint in the Host header.If you dont specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53tttsubstitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of thetttabove cases.                  If you dont specify a value for                   IPAddress:If you dont specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request totttthe domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval youtttspecify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 thentttchecks the health of the endpoint.NoteIf you dont specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 uses only IPv4 to tttsend health checks to the endpoint. If theres no resource record set with a type of A for the tttname that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a tttDNS resolution failed error.If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record setstttand you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, wetttrecommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create attthealth check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the valuetttof FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such asttttus-east-1-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record setsttt(www.example.com).ImportantIn this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matchesttttthe name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with thosettttresource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP,tttHTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passestttthe value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it doestttwhen you specify a value for IPAddress.

If that endpoint returns antttHTTP status code of 2xx or 3xx, the endpoint is healthy. If the endpoint returns an HTTPtttstatus code of 400 or greater, or if the endpoint doesnt respond for a certain amount ofttttime, Amazon Route 53 considers the endpoint unhealthy and also considers the resource record settttunhealthy.The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing betweenttttwo or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base thetttchoice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense intttthe following configurations:Youre checking the health of the resource record sets in a weighted, latency,tttttgeolocation, or failover resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all oftttttthe resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies antttttendpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for thattttttresource record set.You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resourcetttttrecord sets in an alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failovertttttalias resource record set, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource recordtttttsets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets. For more information abouttttttthis configuration, see EvaluateTargetHealth.Amazon Route 53 doesnt check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource recordtttttset, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the Valuetttttelement. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53tttttchecks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for atttresource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose youttthave resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for NorthtttAmerica, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set istttunhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, andtttfor all locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode isttt*), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint isttthealthy.If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that youtttcreate a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for eachtttHTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value ofttttFullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such asttttus-east-1-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record setsttt(example.com).ImportantIn this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value oftttttFullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets andttttthen associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results willttttbe unpredictable.Length Constraints: Maximum length of 64.",

				"description": "Create, change, update, or delete authoritative DNS information on all Amazon Route 53 servers.Send a POST request to:             /2013-04-01/hostedzone/Amazon Route 53 hosted ZoneID/rrset resource. The request body must include a document with aChangeResourceRecordSetsRequest element. The request body contains a list ofchange items, known as a change batch. Change batches are considered transactional changes.When using the Amazon Route 53 API to change resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 either makes all or none of thechanges in a change batch request. This ensures that Amazon Route 53 never partially implements theintended changes to the resource record sets in a hosted zone. For example, a change batch request that deletes the CNAME record forwww.example.com and creates an alias resource record set for www.example.com. Amazon Route 53 deletesthe first resource record set and creates the second resource record set in a singleoperation. If either the DELETE or the CREATE action fails, thenboth changes (plus any other changes in the batch) fail, and the original CNAMErecord continues to exist.ImportantDue to the nature of transactional changes, you cant delete the same resourcerecord set more than once in a single change batch. If you attempt to delete the same changebatch more than once, Amazon Route 53 returns an InvalidChangeBatch error.NoteTo create resource record sets for complex routing configurations, use either thetraffic flow visual editor in the Amazon Route 53 console or the API actions for traffic policies andtraffic policy instances. Save the configuration as a traffic policy, then associate thetraffic policy with one or more domain names (such as example.com) or subdomain names (suchas www.example.com), in the same hosted zone or in multiple hosted zones. You can roll backthe updates if the new configuration isnt performing as expected. For more information, seeUsing Traffic Flow to Route DNSTraffic in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.Use ChangeResourceRecordsSetsRequest to perform the following actions:                  CREATE: Creates a resource record set that has the specified values.                  DELETE: Deletes an existing resource record set that has the specified values.                  UPSERT: If a resource record set does not already exist, AWS createsit. If a resource set does exist, Amazon Route 53 updates it with the values in the request. The values that you need to include in the request depend on the type of resource record set that youre creating, deleting, or updating:            Basic resource record sets (excluding alias, failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                           Failover, geolocation, latency, or weighted resource record sets (excluding alias resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 TTL                                 SetIdentifier                           Alias resource record sets (including failover alias, geolocation alias, latency alias, and weighted alias resource record sets)                           Name                                 Type                                 AliasTarget (includes DNSName, EvaluateTargetHealth, and HostedZoneId)                  SetIdentifier (for failover, geolocation, latency, and weighted resource record sets)When you submit a ChangeResourceRecordSets request, Amazon Route 53 propagates your changes to all of the Amazon Route 53 authoritative DNS servers. While your changes are propagating, GetChange returns a status of PENDING. When propagation is complete, GetChange returns a status of INSYNC. Changes generally propagate to all Amazon Route 53 name servers in a few minutes. In rare circumstances, propagation can take up to 30 minutes.
